A philosophical example has been buzzing around my mind lately. It’s an example of how sin indirectly perverts good things, such that a thing that is good in itself would lead to something being ruined.

I love my *Buena Vista Social Club* album. The music is wonderful, invigorating and relaxing at the same time. I do not speak Spanish. Yet, when I looked at the liner notes, I saw from the English translation that some of the lyrics were quite vulgar. In fact, if I understood Spanish, I don’t think I would be comfortable listening to the album. There you go: what would otherwise have been a good thing (knowing Spanish) becomes in the sinful context a bad thing.

Of course, the million dollar example would be a bad thing that, in a sinful context, becomes a good thing. I don’t think that example exists, though.
