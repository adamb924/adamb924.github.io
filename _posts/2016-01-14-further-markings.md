I have just finished *[A Reader’s Guide to Dag Hammarskjöld’s Waymarks](http://www.daghammarskjold.se/publication/readers-guide-dag-hammarskjolds-waymarks/).* Bernhard Erling, the translator and annotator, has done us a great service by providing a more direct translation, and doing such careful (and, I imagine, tedious) work in finding sources and providing explanations for dates. I don’t agree with all of his interpretations, but I am grateful for his reflections. Some final favorites, all from the Erling translation…

Duty:

> To let oneself be bound by a duty from the moment it is intuited is a part of the integrity which alone entitles one to assume responsibility.

Nature:

> This morning the birds’ song  
> Filled the mind  
> With the night’s cool tranquility.

Continuity:

> Your body, your mind —  
> Only entrusted goods  
> For a baton bearer.

Maturation and loss:

> You will never return.  
> Another man  
> Will find another city.

Forgiveness:

> Easter 1960 Forgiveness breaks the chain of causality through the fact that the one who “forgives” — in love — takes upon himself the responsibility for the consequences of what you did. It therefore always involves sacrifice.
> 
> The price of your own liberation through the sacrifice of another is that you yourself must be willing in the same way to liberate, irrespective of the cost.

Saying yes:

> I don’t know who — or what — put the question. I don’t  
> know when it was put. I don’t remember that I answered.  
> But I once did answer yes to someone — or something.  
> From that time comes my certainty that existence is  
> meaningful and that my life, therefore, in self-surrender,  
> has a goal.
> 
> From that time I have known what it means “not to  
> look back,” and “not to be anxious about tomorrow,”  
> Led through life’s labyrinth by the Ariadne-thread of the  
> answer, I reached a time and a place where I knew that  
> the way leads to a triumph which is a catastrophe and  
> to a catastrophe which is triumph, that the cost of life  
> commitment is reproach and the depth of humiliation the  
> exaltation that is possible for a human being. After that  
> the word “courage” lost its meaning, since nothing could  
> be taken from me.
> 
> As I continued on the way, I learned, step by step, word  
> by word, that behind every saying of the hero of the gospels  
> stands one man and one man’s experience. Also behind the  
> prayer that the cup might pass from him and the promise  
> to empty it. Also behind each word from the cross.

Farewell:

> Is it a new land  
> In another reality  
> Th an that of the day?  
> Or have I lived there,  
> Before the day?
> 
> Awakened,  
> An ordinary morning with gray light  
> Reflected from the street,  
> Awakened —  
> From the dark blue night  
> Above the timberline  
> With moonlight on the moor  
> And the ridge in shadow.  
> Remembered  
> Other dreams,  
> Remembered  
> The same mountain country:  
> Twice I was on the ridges,  
> I stayed by the remotest lake  
> And followed the river  
> To its sources.  
> The seasons have changed  
> And the light  
> And the weather  
> And the hour  
> But it is the same land.  
> And I begin to know the map  
> And the directions.
