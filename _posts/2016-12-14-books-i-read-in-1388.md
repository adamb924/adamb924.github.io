*Midway through the solar Persian year of 1388, I started keeping tracks of the books that I read (in connection with [this discipline](https://pretense.adambaker.org/?p=96)). Motivated party by nostalgia, partly by a desire to see what stuck with me, and partly by pretentiousness, Iâ€™ve decided to go over my lists. This list begins in alphabetical order, because I only started keeping track midway through 1388, so I listed all the books I had read up to that point.*

- - - - - -

- Aliceâ€™s Adventures in Wonderland
- A Childâ€™s History of Englandâ€”My first voluntary Dickens book. Charming; probably whiggish.
- Diggers in the Earthâ€”surprisingly fascinating.
- Frankensteinâ€”Great literature; so much more than a monster story.
- Gulliverâ€™s Travels
- Ivanhoeâ€”Very good.
- Little Womenâ€”Sweetâ€¦ treacly sweet.
- Orthodoxy
- Peter and Wendy
- Phastastesâ€”My first foray into George MacDonald. I reread it recently because I couldnâ€™t remember the plot. But there is no plot, just George MacDonaldâ€™s fertile imagination.
- The Pilgrimâ€™s Progressâ€”Heavy-handed moralizing, terrible fiction. My first intimation that C.S. Lewis and I have different taste.
- Pride and Prejudiceâ€”Not as good as the 1996 BBC original. ðŸ˜‰
- Robinson Crusoeâ€”Great story; difficult prose.
- The Sign of the Fourâ€”Holmes! So I was in my late 20s before I got into this.
- Sketch of Handel and Beethoven
- A Study in Scarlet
- Thomas Wingfold, Curateâ€”Really wonderful moral novel.
- The Time Machine
- On the Incarnationâ€”I know I had read this before, so this was a (fully justified!) re-reading.
- The Resurrection of the Son of Godâ€”Intellectually formative. I read about a hundred pages and ordered the earlier two books in the series.
- Kingdom and Promise
- Why is there something rather than nothing?â€”Great popular-level discussion of philosophical questions.
- Language documentation
- Henry VI, Part 2â€”This is when I decided to finish up Shakespeareâ€™s histories. Thereâ€™s a reason you donâ€™t hear much about Henry VI.
- Henry VI, Part 3
- Life of Anthony
- Tricks of the Tradeâ€”Provides wonderful intuition about qualitative research.
- The Spirit of the Disciplinesâ€”Easily my favorite Willard book; far better than *The Divine Conspiracy*.
- Cultures &amp; Organizationsâ€”Principal component analysis of cultural variables; whatâ€™s not to love?
- A Practical Viewâ€”This book, written by William Wilberforce, sounds like one Iâ€™d like to read. I canâ€™t remember a thing about it.
- Descent into hellâ€”My first Charles Williams book. Mind-bender! Iâ€™d like to re-read it.
- Richard IIIâ€”My reward for making it through the Henry VIâ€™s.
- Please Understand Me IIâ€”I donâ€™t recall the merits of the book; Iâ€™m a big fan of Meyers-Briggs in general. (Iâ€™m a textbook INTJ.)
- Now, Discover Your Strengths
- A Thousand Splendid Sunsâ€”If his first wasnâ€™t exploitative enough for youâ€¦.
- A Manual of Literacy for Preliterate Peoples
- Descent into Chaosâ€”Interesting subject matter, horrible analysis.
- Emma
- Silmarillionâ€”Very difficult to care about.
