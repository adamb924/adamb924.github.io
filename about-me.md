I am a linguist living abroad. I am an evangelical Christian, but with a strong interest in theology and church history. I enjoy good books, and I try only to read books that will be worth my while. Favorite writers on non-fiction subjects are N.T. Wright are Michael Polanyi. Favorite fiction authors are Dostoyevsky, Shakespeare, George MacDonald (These are scattered among many others, however.) In the past few years I have taken a deep dive into classical languages. I like baroque music, but am trying to broaden my taste.

My professional interests are pretty well illustrated on [my professional site](http://www.adambaker.org/).
