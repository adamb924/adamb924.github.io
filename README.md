# Instructions

For the blog site, use this to test locally:

```
cd C:\Users\Adam\Documents\pretense.adambaker.org
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

Or just to build:
```
bundle exec jekyll build
```

But you just make your commit in this director. Netlify will run Jekyll on their servers to build it.

## Deploy

cd C:\Users\Adam\Documents\pretense.adambaker.org
git add .
git commit -m 'message'
git push origin
