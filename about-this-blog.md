This is a place for me to record my thoughts on what I’m reading and thinking about. I’m a bit scatterbrained, so I read and think pretty widely, but without an immediate outlet for writing I am worried about what I will retain in the long run. This is a dumping ground.

“Pretense” — as in “false motive”, and also as in “pretentious”. Caveat lector.
